Welcome to Spotify2Mp3

This is a basic/experimental website which uses flask as a backend and javascript on the frontend. 

LANGUAGES: python / javascript / html / css  

DESCRIPTION: The goal of this website is that you will sign into your Spotify account and you will be taken to the inventory page
where you will see 5 buttons (saved songs, top songs, recent songs, saved playlists, and saved albums). You can then 
press any of them and will be redirected to a page which displays the information of the songs in a table format. From
there you willbe able to download any song you choose or you can press the download all button to, well, download all
the songs. I used youtube_dl in order to download the the audio of the songs from youtube videos, and used a third party 
module in order to search for the urls of the youtube vidoes. In the future i plan on writing my own "youtube scrapper"
in order to search for the song urls on youtube.
